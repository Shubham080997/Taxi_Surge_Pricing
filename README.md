# Taxi_Surge_Pricing
1.Problem Statement
Data provided by an Indian cab aggregator
service Sigma Cabs. Their customers can
download their app on smartphones and
book a cab from anywhere in the cities they
operate in. They, in turn, search for cabs
from various service providers and provide
the best option to their clients across
available options. They have been in
operation for a little less than a year now.
During this period, they have captured surge
pricing types from the service providers.
